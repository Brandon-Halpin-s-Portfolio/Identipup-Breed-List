# Identipup-Breed-List
My work for the Identipup app, involving the list of dog breeds the user may choose from

The Identipup app is an iOS app that allows users to take pictures of dogs and dynamically identify the breed using machine learning. The app was created by Nahckjoon Kim, 
Derick Chen, and myself. 
My contribution was to create a view which brought up the list of dog breeds that were supported by the app (i.e. the dog breeds that the app could identify). Clicking on one of
the breeds would open a new window with the American Kennel Club web page corresponding to the breed, allowing the user to learn more about the dog breed in question.
